## Introduction
Double Sided Tetris is Web, Android, and iOS tetris game, which has got two tetris games inside - sometimes blocks go upward, sometimes downwards.
This application is made with JavaScript, and Cordova (which allows this app to be multiplatform).
Tetris looks easy to write, but to be honest, this was a lot of work - all logic (collisions etc.) is made by mathematic operations at matrixes.

## Features
* Play tetris, in which blocks go up and down
* Invert steering according to blocks direction
* Rotate and move blocks
* Blocks line disappear after filling it
* Save highscore to online database
